Read more on how to create widgets in
the [instantsearch.js documentation](https://community.algolia.com/instantsearch.js/documentation/#custom-widgets).

We also have a more complex example using React: [instantsearch-googlemaps](https://github.com/instantsearch/instantsearch-googlemaps).

To run the example you can:
  + clone this repository
  + run `npm run dev` in the cloned repository
  + open http://localhost:3000

## Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Testing

```sh
npm test
```

## Publishing the widget

We provide everything for this boilerplate for you to publish it
on both [npm](https://npmjs.org/) and [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/).

If you want to do the same with your widget, [create a new jsDelivr project](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). Then use the `npm run release` task from this project.

Example:

```sh
SEMVER_TOKEN=minor npm run release
```

[instantsearch-googlemaps](https://github.com/instantsearch/instantsearch-googlemaps) is an example
project that is deployed and usable on both npm and jsDelivr.
